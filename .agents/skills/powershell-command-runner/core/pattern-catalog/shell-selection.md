# Shell Selection

status: active

## Trigger

Use when a command may be written with Bash, cmd.exe, PowerShell, or WSL syntax.

## Safe Shape

- Check the active shell before borrowing syntax from another platform.
- In PowerShell, use cmdlets, semicolons, and PowerShell variable syntax.
- Treat `&&` as version-sensitive PowerShell syntax; avoid it unless the active shell and PowerShell version support it. Do not use Bash-only idioms such as POSIX command-substitution semantics, `rm -rf`, or unescaped path assumptions unless the active shell supports them.
- PowerShell subexpressions are valid PowerShell syntax; use them with PowerShell semantics.

## Failure Signals

- `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator`
- `The term 'rm' is not recognized`
- path separators or quoting copied from Bash fail in PowerShell
